“Using machine learning models to identify spending patterns among customers”

## 📊 Objective

To uncover insights into spending and saving patterns during inflationary periods and identify at-risk financial behaviors using machine learning techniques.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Tableau (for dashboard creation)
- SAS (exploratory statistics)
- Power BI (optional)
- Excel (for preliminary data filtering)

## 🧪 Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Removed null entries and duplicates.
   - Converted currency formats.
   - Created new features such as spending ratios and savings indicators.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Time-series trends in income and spending.
   - Category-wise expenditure analysis.

3. **Clustering (K-Means)**
   - Segmented users into behavior-based clusters (e.g., savers vs. spenders).

4. **Classification**
   - Built models (Random Forest, SVM) to predict financial behavior patterns.

5. **Evaluation**
   - Used silhouette scores, confusion matrices, and F1 scores to assess model performance.

## 📈 Key Findings

- A majority of users reduced spending on leisure and dining during inflation.
- Financially vulnerable individuals had low savings rates and high credit usage.
- Classification models achieved over 85% accuracy in predicting spending behavior types.
